# A network analysis of ASUCD

Note that this data comes from the 2023-2024 roster. It is not completely accurate - there is missing data for all members in ASUCD units. The data only contains information from ASUCD committees and commissions, as well as the senate table.

This project, "The Oracle of ASUCD," is named after "The Oracle of Bacon" - https://oracleofbacon.org/. Once I get accurate data, I want to create a similar application using BFS!
